We are building this repository with immediate goal of supplying
materials for students preparing for a specific International
Baccalaureate test.

We want to leverage this effort as a pilot project for a more general
collection of math teaching materials that can be used easily and
effectively by teachers with a minimum of complications.

Currently Latex is the most used mark up language for anyone producing
mathematics documents.  To comply with that trend and maximize the
usefulness of the learning curve of maintaining the materials herein
we are using latex as our markup language for this project.
