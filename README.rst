Math Exercise Document Repository
=================================

Overview
--------

This repository was originally build with the immediate goal of
supplying some materials for students who were preparing for a
specific international baccalaureate test.

This project has now become a pelican generated web site generator
pre-seeded with those same materials.  We hope to convert this into a
collaborative project for growing a colleciton of math exercise
questions which can be shared among teachers and students.

Collaborators can contribute to the project by adding exercises,
written as text files using restructured text markup.
